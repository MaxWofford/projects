# swift-fibonacci

## Swift Challenge 1

### Instructions  
- The Fib Sequence consists of the following: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`
- Write a swift program to generate the nth number of the sequence
- For example the 6th number of the fib sequence is 5
- You can write this program in either Xcode, Playgrounds or [runswiftlang] (http://www.runswiftlang.com)


### Input: 
  - Calculate the 6th, 18th and 54th fibonacci sequence


### Output:
  - `5, 1597, 53316291173`
